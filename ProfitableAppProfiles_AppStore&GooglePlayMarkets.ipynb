    "### Context\n",
    "We're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and our job is to enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aim\n",
    "Our aim for this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. \n",
    "\n",
    "At our company, we only build apps that are **free to download and install**, and our main source of revenue consists of **in-app ads**. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the **number of users that use our app**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of this project we will analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skills / Libraries / Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, we will only employ the standard Python library in this project, using the below to performing some **practical data analysis**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some Python basics (arithmetical operations, variables, common data types, etc.)\n",
    "- List and for loops\n",
    "- Conditional statements\n",
    "- Dictionaries and frequency tables\n",

    "\n",
    "- Look to create an app that will compete with the titans that are `Facebook`, `Google Maps`, `Bible` etc. However, this would require significant investment to reseach and implement, and for our pruposes does not really work as a strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go back to the data, strip these apps that are skewing the results to get a more reasonable and accurate representation of what is popular outside of these top tier apps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the data in its current form however, the following thoughts occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We may want to consider the **saturation** of apps in a particular category. Take `Social Networking` for example, which contains over 100 individual apps. We can see from user reviews for Facebook, Pinterest, WhatsApp Messenger etc, that if this a Social Networking app takes off, it has the potential to be incredibly popular. Perhaps then a new messaging app, for example would seem like a good idea. However, how to make it stand out from the noise of 100+ existing apps, all clamouring for market share?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Food & Drink`** is a genre with upper-mid range popularity, and has relatively few unique apps. Perhaps an app would have greater chance of success here. Apart from existing food delivery service apps, there is one high ranking app which allows you to make reservations. We could go one step further by building an app that returns all current specials and deals at restaurants in a particular location, and then allows you to book your table. This has the added benefit of not requiring any specialist knowledge. Furthmore, as the App Store has such a high concentration of apps that are 'fun', this more practical (yet still entertainment-related) app might have a chance at standing out.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Book`** is a genre with some potential also. There are relatively few apps to compete against, but a good level of popularity. We could take popular book and turn it into an app with special features in addition to the raw version of the book, e.g. daily quotes from the book, an audio version, quizzes about the book, an online forum for readers to discuss etc. On top of that, we could also embed a dictionary within the app, so users don't need to exit our app to look up words in an external app. As with the `Food & Drink` idea, this more practical app might stand out amongst the fun apps which dominate the App Store.\n"
