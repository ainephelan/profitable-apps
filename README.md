# profitable-apps
Analyse app data to find profitable app profiles for the iOS and Android markets.

## Context
We're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and our job is to enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.

## Aim
Our aim for this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets.

At our company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app.

Over the course of this project we will analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.

## Skills / Libraries / Tools
Note, we will only employ the standard Python library in this project, using the below to performing some practical data analysis:

- Some Python basics (arithmetical operations, variables, common data types, etc.)
- List and for loops
- Conditional statements
- Dictionaries and frequency tables
- Functions
- Jupyter Notebook
